/// @brief Callback is an alternative to std::function<void(void)>, providing a general carrier
/// of callable structure with no parameters and no return value. Compared with function pointers
/// of type void (*)(), Callback can carry lambda expressions with captures, and does not need to
/// pay attention to the captured content. It should be noted that Callback itself does not store
/// the callable structure it carries like std::function<void(void)>, so it is necessary to ensure
/// that it is used within the life cycle of the callable structure.
