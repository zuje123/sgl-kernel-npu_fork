                if `use_ue8m0=False`. With `use_ue8m0=True`, the second one is packed and shaped as
                `[num_local_experts, num_max_dispatch_tokens_per_rank * num_ranks, hidden // 512]` with type `torch.int`.
                Notice that, the last-two-dimension of the scaling tensors are in column-major for TMA compatibility.
                With `use_fp8=False`, the result would be a tensor shaped as
                `[num_local_experts, num_max_dispatch_tokens_per_rank * num_ranks, hidden]` with `torch.bfloat16`.
                Moreover, not all tokens are valid, only some of the `num_max_dispatch_tokens_per_rank * num_ranks` are,
                as we do not synchronize CPU received count with GPU (also not incompatible with CUDA graph if synced).
            recv_count: a tensor shaped `[num_local_experts]` with type `torch.int`, indicating how many tokens each
                expert receives. As mentioned before, not all tokens are valid in `recv_x`.
            handle: the communication handle to be used in the `low_latency_combine` function.
            event: the event after executing the kernel (valid only if `async_finish` is set).
            hook: the receiving hook function (valid only if `return_recv_hook` is set).

        A low-latency implementation for combine.

        Arguments:
            x: `[num_local_experts, num_max_dispatch_tokens_per_rank * num_ranks, hidden]` with `torch.bfloat16`,
                the local calculated tokens to be sent to this original rank and reduced.
            topk_idx: `[num_combined_tokens, num_topk]` with `torch.int64`, the expert indices selected by the dispatched
                tokens. `-1` indices (not selecting any expert) are supported. Note that, `num_combined_tokens` equals
                to the number of dispatched tokens.
            topk_weights: `[num_combined_tokens, num_topk]` with `torch.float`, the expert weights selected by the dispatched
                tokens. The received tokens will be reduced with the weights in this tensor.
            handle: the communication handle given by the `dispatch` function.
            zero_copy: whether the tensor is already copied into the RDMA buffer, should be cooperative
                with `get_next_low_latency_combine_buffer`.
            async_finish: the current stream will not wait for the communication kernels to be finished if set.
            return_recv_hook: return a receiving hook if set. If set, the kernel will just do the RDMA request issues,
                but **without actually receiving the data**. You must call the received hook to make sure the data's arrival.
                If you do not set this flag, the kernel will ensure the data's arrival.
            out: the in-place output tensor, if set, the kernel will write the result to this tensor and return it directly.

        Returns:
            combined_x: the reduced token tensor, with shape `[num_combined_tokens, hidden]` and type `torch.bfloat16`.
            event: the event after executing the kernel (valid only if `async_finish` is set).
            hook: the receiving hook function (valid only if `return_recv_hook` is set).
